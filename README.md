# Unhandled Missing Request Body in Express.js POST Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: failure to properly handle missing or malformed request bodies in POST requests.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Bug Description

The original code lacks error handling for scenarios where the request body is missing entirely or is missing required fields. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as crashes or silent failures, making debugging difficult.  The improved version addresses this by explicitly checking for the presence and validity of required fields before processing the request.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run `npm install express` to install the Express.js dependency.
4. Run `node bug.js` to start the server with the buggy code.
5. Send a POST request to `/users` with a missing or incomplete JSON body (e.g., missing `name` or `email`). Observe the error (or lack thereof).
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 using `node bugSolution.js` to see the improved error handling.
